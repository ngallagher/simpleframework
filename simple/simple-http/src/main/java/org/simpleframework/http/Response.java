/**
 * This is used to represent the HTTP response. This provides methods 
 * that can be used to set various characteristics of the response.
 * An <code>OutputStream</code> can be acquired via this interface
 * which can be used to write the response body. A buffer size can be
 * specified when acquiring the output stream which allows data to
 * be buffered until it over flows or is flushed explicitly. This
 * buffering allows a partially written response body to be reset.
 * <p>
 * This should never allow the message body be sent if it should not 
 * be sent with the headers as of RFC 2616 rules for the presence of 
 * a message body. A message body must not be included with a HEAD 
 * request or with a 304 or a 204 response. A proper implementation
 * of this will prevent a message body being sent if the response
 * is to a HEAD request of if there is a 304 or 204 response code.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that the <code>Response</code> controls
 * the processing of the HTTP pipeline. The next HTTP request is 
 * not processed until the response has been sent. To ensure that
 * the response is sent the <code>close</code> method of the response
 * or the output stream should be used. This will notify the server
 * to dispatch the next request in the pipeline for processing.
