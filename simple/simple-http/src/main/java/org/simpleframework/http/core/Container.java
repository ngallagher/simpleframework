/**
 * The <code>Container</code> object is used to process HTTP requests
 * and compose HTTP responses. The <code>Request</code> objects that
 * are handed to this container contain all information relating to 
 * the received message. The responsibility of the container is to
 * interpret the request and compose a suitable response.
 * <p>
 * All implementations must ensure that the container is thread safe
 * as it will receive multiple HTTP transactions concurrently. Also
 * it should be known that the <code>Response</code> object used to
 * deliver the HTTP response will only commit and send once it has 
 * its <code>OutputStream</code> closed.
 * <p>
 * The <code>Container</code> is entirely responsible for the HTTP 
 * message headers and body. It is up to the implementation to ensure
 * that it complies to RFC 2616 or any previous specification. All 
 * headers and the status line can be modified by this object.
