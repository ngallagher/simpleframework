/**
 * The <code>ContainerSocketProcessor</code> object is a connector
 * that dispatch requests from a connected pipeline. SSL connections
 * and plain connections can be processed by this implementation. It
 * collects data from the connected pipelines and constructs the
 * requests and responses used to dispatch to the container.
 * <p>
 * In order to process the requests this uses two thread pools. One 
 * is used to collect data from the pipelines and create the requests.
 * The other is used to service those requests. Such an architecture
 * ensures that the serving thread does not have to deal with I/O
 * operations. All data is consumed before it is serviced.
