/**
 * This is used to represent the HTTP response. This provides methods that can
 * be used to set various characteristics of the response. The
 * <code>OutputStream</code> of the <code>Response</code> can be retrieved from
 * this interface as can the I.P address of the client that will be receiving
 * the <code>Response</code>. The attributes of the connection can be retrieved
 * also. This provides a set of methods that can be used to set the attributes
 * of the stream so the <code>Response</code> can be transported properly. The
 * headers can be set and will be sent once a commit is made, or when there is
 * content sent over the output stream.
 * <p>
 * This should never allow the message body be sent if it should not be sent
 * with the headers as of RFC 2616 rules for the presence of a message body. A
 * message body must not be included with a HEAD request or with a 304 or a 204
 * response. A proper implementation of this will prevent a message body being
 * sent if the response is to a HEAD request of if there is a 304 or 204
 * response code.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that the <code>Response</code> controls the
 * processing of the HTTP pipeline. The next HTTP request is not processed until
 * the response has committed. The response is committed once the
 * <code>commit</code> method is invoked if there is NO content body. Committing
 * with a content body is done only if correct content is given. The
 * <code>OutputStream</code> acts as a client and commits the response once the
 * specified content has been written to the issued <code>OutputStream</code>.
