/**
 * The <code>Request</code> is used to provide an interface to the 
 * HTTP entity body and message header. This provides methods that 
 * allow the entity body to be acquired as a stream, string, or if
 * the message is a multipart encoded body, then the individual
 * parts of the request body can be acquired.
 * <p>
 * This can also maintain data during the request lifecycle as well
 * as the session lifecycle. A <code>Session</code> is made available
 * for convenience. It provides a means for the services to associate
 * data with a given client session, which can be retrieved when 
 * there are subsequent requests sent to the server.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that the entity body can be read multiple
 * times from the request. Calling <code>getInputStream</code> will
 * start reading from the first byte in the body regardless of the
 * number of times it is called. This allows POST parameters as well
 * as multipart bodies to be read from the stream if desired.
