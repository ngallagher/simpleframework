/**
 * This class is used to represent a generic cookie. This exposes
 * the fields that a cookie can have. By default the version of the 
 * <code>Cookie</code> is set to 1. The version can be configured 
 * using the <code>setVersion</code> method. The domain, path, 
 * security, and expiry of the cookie can also be set using their 
 * respective set methods.
 * <p>
 * The <code>toString</code> method allows the <code>Cookie</code>
 * to be converted back into text form. This text form converts the
 * cookie according to the Set-Cookie header form. This is done so
 * that a created <code>Cookie</code> instance can be converted
 * to a string which can be used as a a HTTP header.
