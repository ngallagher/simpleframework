/**
 * The <code>SocketTransport</code> object offers a transport that can
 * send and receive bytes in a non-blocking manner. The contract of
 * the <code>Transport</code> is that it must either write the data
 * it is asked to write or it must queue that data for delivery. For
 * the vast majority of cases data is written directly to the socket
 * without any need for queuing or selection for write ready events.
 * <p>
 * In the event that the client TCP window is full and writing would
 * block this makes use of a queue of buffers which can be used to 
 * append data to. The buffers are lazily instantiated so the memory
 * required is created only in the rare case that they are needed.
 * Once a buffer is full it is queued to an asynchronous thread where
 * the buffer queue is drained and sent to the client when the TCP
 * window of the client is capable of accepting it.
 * <p>
 * In order to improve the network performance of this transport the
 * default packet size sent to the TCP stack is four kilobytes. This
 * ensures that the fragments of response delivered to the TCP layer
 * are sufficiently large for optimum network performance.
