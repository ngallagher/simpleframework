 * this uses an SSL engine provided with the transport to direct 
 * the conversation. The SSL engine tells the negotiation what is
 * expected next, whether this is a response to the client or a 
 * message from it. During the negotiation this may need to wait 
 * for either a write ready event or a read ready event. Event 
 * notification is done using the processor provided.
