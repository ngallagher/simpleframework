 * The <code>Transport</code> interface represents a low level means
 * to deliver content to the connected client. Typically this will
 * be a connected, non-blocking, TCP connection. However, for tests
 * and other purposes this may be adapted. The general contract of
 * the transport is that it provides non-blocking reads and blocking
 * writes. Blocking writes are required to ensure that memory does
 * not build up in output buffers during high load periods.
