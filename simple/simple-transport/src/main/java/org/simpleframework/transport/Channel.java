/**
 * The <code>Channel</code> interface represents a connected channel
 * through which data can be sent and received. Typically a channel
 * will have a connected TCP socket, which can be used to determine
 * when the channel is read ready, and write ready. A channel can
 * also contain a bag of attributes used to describe the connection.
 * <p>
 * Reading and writing to a channel is performed using two special
 * interfaces. The first is the <code>ByteCursor</code> object which 
 * is used to read data from the channel in a non-blocking manner. 
 * This can also be used to reset data if it has read too much. To 
 * write the <code>ByteWriter</code> can be used, this provides a 
 * blocking interface much like a conventional output stream.
